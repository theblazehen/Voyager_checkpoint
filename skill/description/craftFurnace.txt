async function craftFurnace(bot) {
    // The function is about crafting a furnace. If the bot does not have a crafting table in the inventory, it will mine a dark oak log, craft dark oak planks, and then craft a crafting table. After placing the crafting table near the bot, it will check if there is enough cobblestone in the inventory. If not, it will mine more cobblestone until there are at least 8 cobblestones in the inventory. Finally, it will craft a furnace using the crafting table.
