async function craftStoneSword(bot) {
    // The function crafts a stone sword using cobblestone and sticks. It checks if there is enough cobblestone and sticks in the inventory, and if not, it mines cobblestone and crafts sticks as needed. If there is no crafting table in the inventory, it crafts one. Then, it places the crafting table near the bot and crafts a stone sword using the crafting table. Finally, it sends a chat message indicating that a stone sword has been crafted.
