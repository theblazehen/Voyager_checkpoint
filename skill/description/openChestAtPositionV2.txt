async function openChestAtPosition(bot) {
    // The function is about opening a chest at a specific position. It first moves the bot to the chest position using the pathfinder. Then, it checks if there is a chest block at the specified position. If there is a chest, it calls another function to check the items inside the chest and sends a chat message saying that the chest is opened. If there is no chest, it sends a chat message saying that no chest is found.
