async function craftSixteenTorches(bot) {
    // The function crafts 16 torches if the bot does not already have enough. It calculates the number of sticks and coal required to craft the torches and checks if the bot has enough of each. If not, it mines the necessary resources and crafts them into sticks and coal. If the bot does not have a crafting table, it mines the necessary resources and crafts them into a crafting table. It then places the crafting table and crafts the torches. Finally, it reports the number of torches crafted.
