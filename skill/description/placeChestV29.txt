async function placeChest(bot) {
    // The function is about finding a suitable position near the bot to place a chest and placing it there. It searches for a position adjacent to the bot in four directions and checks if the block is air. If a suitable position is found, it places a chest at that position and sends a chat message. If no suitable position is found, it sends a chat message indicating that it cannot place a chest.
