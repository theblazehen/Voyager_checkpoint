async function killAnimalForFood(bot) {
    // The function is about killing an animal (cow, pig, chicken, or sheep) for food. It equips a stone pickaxe and explores the environment until finding an animal within 32 blocks. Once an animal is found, it kills the animal using the `killMob` function and collects the dropped item (meat). Finally, it moves to the location of the animal and sends a chat message indicating that an animal has been killed for food.
