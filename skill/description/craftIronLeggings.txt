async function craftIronLeggings(bot) {
    // The function is about crafting iron leggings. If the bot does not have enough iron ingots, it will mine iron ore and smelt it into iron ingots. If the bot does not have a crafting table, it will mine a dark oak log, craft dark oak planks, and then craft a crafting table. It will then find a suitable position to place the crafting table and place it there. Finally, it will craft iron leggings using the crafting table.
