async function craftIronAxe(bot) {
    // The function crafts an iron axe using 3 iron ingots and 2 sticks. If the required items are not in the inventory, the bot mines iron ore and smelts it into iron ingots, and crafts sticks as needed. If there is no crafting table in the inventory, the bot crafts one and places it on a suitable block. Finally, the bot crafts an iron axe using the crafting table and the required items.
