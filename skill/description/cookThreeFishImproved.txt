async function cookThreeFishImproved(bot) {
    // The function is about fishing until 3 raw fish are caught, then cooking them in a furnace using coal as fuel. First, the bot explores the environment to find a water block and equips a fishing rod. Once the water block is found, the bot fishes until 3 raw fish are caught. If there is no furnace in the inventory, the bot mines cobblestone and crafts a furnace. Then, the bot finds a suitable solid block to place the furnace on and cooks the 3 fish in the furnace using coal as fuel.
