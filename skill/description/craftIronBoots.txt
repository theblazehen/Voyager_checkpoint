async function craftIronBoots(bot) {
    // The function crafts a pair of iron boots. It first checks if the bot has enough iron ingots in the inventory, and if not, it mines iron ore and smelts it into iron ingots. Then it checks if the bot has a crafting table in the inventory, and if not, it mines a dark oak log, crafts dark oak planks, and then crafts a crafting table. After placing the crafting table near the bot, it crafts iron boots using the crafting table.
