async function craftStonePickaxe(bot) {
    // The function crafts a stone pickaxe using a crafting table. If the bot does not have a crafting table in the inventory, it mines a dark oak log and crafts a crafting table. Then, it places the crafting table near the bot and crafts a stone pickaxe using the crafting table. Finally, it sends a chat message indicating that a stone pickaxe has been crafted.
