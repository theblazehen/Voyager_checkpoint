async function mineFiveRedstoneOres(bot) {
    // The function is about mining 5 redstone ores using an iron pickaxe or better. If the bot does not have an iron pickaxe or better, it will mine iron ores and craft an iron pickaxe. Once the iron pickaxe or better is available, it will be equipped in the hand. The bot will then explore underground until finding a redstone ore. Once a redstone ore is found, the bot will mine a total of 5 redstone ores using the equipped pickaxe. Finally, the bot will send a chat message indicating that it has mined 5 redstone ores.
