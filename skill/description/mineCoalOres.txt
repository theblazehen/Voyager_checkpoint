async function mineCoalOres(bot) {
    // The function is about mining 5 coal ores using a stone pickaxe. First, check if the bot has a stone pickaxe in the inventory. If not, call the `craftStonePickaxe` function to craft one. Then, equip the stone pickaxe in the hand. Next, explore the environment until finding a coal ore block. Once a coal ore block is found, mine a total of 5 coal ores using the stone pickaxe. Finally, the bot will chat that it has mined 5 coal ores.
