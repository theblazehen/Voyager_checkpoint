    // The function is about mining 5 copper ores using an iron pickaxe. First, check if the bot has already mined 5 or more copper ores. If so, return. If not, equip the iron pickaxe in the hand. Next, explore the environment until finding a copper ore block. Once a copper ore block is found, mine a total of 5 copper ores using the iron pickaxe.
